# Interface Builder 

This is a package that automate the generation of a silica-water interface. 
Various options to create a silica surface, a silica system, a silica-water system is available. 


The main goal is to be able to fully automate the process of generating specific interface geometry and silanol concentration specific surfaces. 

Doing a preparation of silica surface is systematized. 
1. temperature-quench approach is fully automated with a user-specified features 
2. passivation and setting up a particular silanol concentration is fully automated. 
3. adding water on the surface of a particular shape and dimension is possible. 
4. rearrangement of different approaches in preparing the silica is possible e.g. minimize first then anneal, just anneal without minimizing, or just minimize and thermalize, etc. without having to prepare the script over and over again -- a single line of code will do each approaches and just putting the specs
